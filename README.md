The Iris dataset is one of the most famous datasets in machine learning and statistics, primarily used for classification tasks. It was introduced by the biologist Edgar Anderson in 1935 and popularized by the statistician Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper. The dataset contains measurements of iris flowers and is often used as a beginner's dataset for testing classification algorithms and teaching data analysis concepts.

Structure of the Iris Dataset
The dataset contains 150 samples from three different species of iris flowers:

Iris Setosa
Iris Versicolor
Iris Virginica
Each sample consists of four features (attributes) that describe the physical characteristics of the flowers:

Sepal Length: Length of the sepal in centimeters.
Sepal Width: Width of the sepal in centimeters.
Petal Length: Length of the petal in centimeters.
Petal Width: Width of the petal in centimeters.
